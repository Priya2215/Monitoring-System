Problem Statement: Develop an application capable of remotely monitoring processes, CPU, and memory usage on a target machine. The collected data should be stored in a MongoDB database. In the event of detecting abnormal patterns compared to standard behavior, the application should provide the option to take corrective actions, such as stopping the monitored application. The gathered information should be displayed in a web-based dashboard for easy access and analysis.
